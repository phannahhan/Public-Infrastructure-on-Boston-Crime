```{r bluebikes map, echo = FALSE}
## I used instructions from
## https://www.r-spatial.org/r/2018/10/25/ggplot2-sf.html. I realized I only
## wanted to map within a specific latitudinal/longitudinal range because the
## bluebike data is only for the city of Boston. To determine the range, I
## sorted the bluebikes table by latitude in descending order, and then by
## longitude. Once I made the map, to plot the locations of the bikes, I used
## geom_point. I also added the locations for the streetlights in a separate
## map, but I realized there's a higher density of streetlights than bluebikes,
## so I'll need to restyle the map for the next milestone.

# need to show points. Facet wrap by type of crime. Group crime by year.
